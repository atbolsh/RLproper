Next steps are straightforward.

Play with background planning using DynaQ and DynaQ+. Do the maze thing with both.
Do problem 8.4 for programming (the proposal won't work because the agent won't 
"see the path" towards the unexplored item).

Implement a priority-sweeping Queueeueueu.

Remake the simple diagram that shows advantages and disadvantages of on-policy updates / implement Real-Time Dynamic Programming.

Try to implement / play with just one Monte Carlo Tree Search situation. Download code if necessary.
DO AT LEAST ONE thing with Decision-Time planning.

After all that is done, move on to part II.
