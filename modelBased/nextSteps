1) Test, debug new dqp on Walled.

2) Remove taus priorityQ; debug it vs dq on the other maze (use the random seed).

3) Add a version w/ taus but no cringey "iterating through all states"; bascially, mix priority updates w/ random updates. Bet that will work. If not, don't sweat.

4) Move on to Real-Time Dynamic Programming.
