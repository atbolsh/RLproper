Models in Stochastic and Changing Environments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Instead of a single state looked up via state-action pair, you have a dictionary of seen stuff, with weights.

Simplest case is counts.

More complex case, for environment that might change, whenever its updated, you discount by rate**tau (time since seen). 
That way, the past is not an insurmountable barrier to change.
